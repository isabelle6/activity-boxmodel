The ears are large and stand erect, open at the front and parallel, but they often are pulled back during movement. They have a long neck, which is raised when excited and lowered when moving at a fast pace. The tail is bushy on the underside, and forms a slightly curved sabre-shape reaching to the hock when at rest. German Shepherds have a variety of colors, the most common of which are <strong>tan/black</strong> and <strong>red/black</strong>. Most color varieties have black masks and black body markings which can range from a classic "saddle" to an over-all "blanket." Rarer colour variations include the <strong>sable</strong>, <strong>all-black</strong>, <strong>all-white</strong>, <strong>liver</strong> and <strong>blue</strong> varieties.</p>
